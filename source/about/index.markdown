### zlu

![avatar]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/zlu-wdi-thumb.jpg)

I'm a programmer who enjoys practicing yoga.  

I've worked in technology for a while and have dipped my foot in storage, insurance, telecommunication, and social media marketing industries.  As a developer, I always wanted to be a user of my software, so I can be passionate about programming it.  After attending [Deborah Burkman](https://www.foryogi.com/teachers/503)'s yoga retreat in Thailand, I started [ForYogi](https://foryogi.com).  It's a perfect blend of my two passions, writing code for yoga.

I now spend time between ForYogi, consulting, and advising start-ups.  


### On The Web
