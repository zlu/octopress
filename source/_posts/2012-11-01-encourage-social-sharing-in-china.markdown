I recently spent a month in China, where access to Facebook, Twitter, and GooglePlus are blocked.
Many social sharing functions on blogs (and various websites) stop working in China.  I have been using @octopress
to blog and since none of the built-in sharing functions work in China, I decided to add the support for the sharing on
[Sina Weibo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo).

There are two basic sharing functions:

* There should be a share button for Weibo, which allows the user to easily share the link
of the blog entry.  It should also display how many times the entry has been shared.
* There should be a follow button (and follower count) at the side bar for Weibo.

After a bit work, here's the source code that does just that for other Octopress users.

Enjoy.
