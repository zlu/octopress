Selecting a Content Management System (CMS) is never an easy task.  I have recently spent a good amount of time tinkering with different implementation and would like to share my learnings here.

There are many solutions on the market so you should solidify your requirements.  Here are mine:

This CMS will be used for [ForYogi](https://foryogi.com)  

- Tutorial - I need to add tutorials on how to use the site for teachers/studios/users.  
- Knowledge Base - I need to be able to add articles for yoga-related topics.  It can be as simple as definition of  _yogi_ or Sanskrit terminologies such as _asana_.  
- Help - help content has to be accessed by the application and displayed in various parts of the app.
- FAQ. 
- Searching capability.
- Customizable layout.
- Drop-in support for existing Rails project.
 - Inexpensive - Some hosted solution can get pricey depending on storage and other factors.
 
 ####General Impression
 
 CMS is often used by developers to create customizable mostly static websites for clients.
